# TrueConnect Database Verification and Fixes

This document outlines the database issues that were encountered and the steps taken to resolve them.

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Tables**: The `profiles` table was referenced but did not exist in the database.
2. **Column Name Mismatches**: The `community_members` table had a column name issue where `createdAt` was used instead of `joinedAt`.
3. **Foreign Key Constraints**: There were issues with foreign key constraints that prevented proper deletion of test data.

## Fix Approach

### 1. Database Reset and Schema Recreation

We created a solution that properly resets the database and allows TypeORM to recreate the schema with proper foreign key constraints:

- Created `reset-and-seed.js` that drops all tables in the correct order (child tables first)
- Allowed TypeORM to recreate the database schema when the application starts
- Fixed column naming inconsistencies

### 2. Error with `profile` vs. `users`

The code was trying to access a `profiles` table, but the project architecture appears to have moved profile data directly into the `users` table, which is a better design.

### 3. Community Members Table

Fixed issues with the `community_members` table column naming. The entity was defined with `joinedAt` but the script was trying to insert with `createdAt`.

## How to Reset and Seed the Database

Follow these steps to completely reset and re-seed the database:

1. **Reset the database**:
   ```
   node reset-and-seed.js
   ```
   This will drop all tables.

2. **Restart the NestJS server**:
   ```
   cd backend && npm run start:dev
   ```
   The server will automatically recreate all tables with proper schema.

3. **Seed test data**:
   ```
   node seed-test-data.js
   ```
   This will create test users, communities, and other data.

## Verification

After following the steps above, the database should be properly initialized with all the necessary tables and relationships. You can use the following scripts to verify:

- `test-db-connection.js` - Tests basic database connectivity
- `db-diagnostics.js` - Shows detailed information about tables and columns
- `test-api-connection.js` - Tests the API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter additional issues:

1. Check foreign key constraints in the database
2. Verify that column names in entities match column names in database tables
3. Ensure that the correct tables are being referenced in your code

## Further Improvements

1. Add database migrations for future schema changes
2. Implement more comprehensive database health checks
3. Consider containerization for consistent development environments
